This isn't even a proper exploit...

The program level08 will open a file and back it up in
the directory backup.

If we try to open directly /home/users/level09/.pass,
it will inform us that it can't open ./backups//home/users/level09/.pass

Since the path seems to be a problem, what if we simply make a symbolic link ?

It works...
