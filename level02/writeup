This level is a classic format string exploit. The binary will ask us to
log in, and, if this succeeds, will open us a shell.

However, if the identification fails, it will inform us that our login is invalid,
by writing it with printf, and no protection... It is easy then to overwrite the
return address and replace it with the part where the shell is open.
