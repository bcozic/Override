This level is a pure reverse engineering task. The program will ask for a login,
and a serial number. I will then compute a pseudo checksum of the login, and if
the serial number we entered match the checksum, it will open us a shell.

There is a mechanism to catch SIG_TRAP in order to make it harder to use gdb, but
we can easily make our debugger skip that call. As such, there is no need to reverse
the computation, we just need to enter a login of our choice, jump to the right place
in gdb, and get the right serial number.
