Here we have two fgets with a size higher than their buffer.

They are used to set a structure containing two strings: a message and an user_name, and
an integer containing the size of the message.

The first fgets is for the user name. Its buffer size is 40, but fgets takes 128 characters,
which means we can overwrite the size of the message.

The second fgets is here to get the message. Instead of putting it directly in the
structure, it is taken in a temporary buffer, and then copied in the structure.

However, the temporary buffer has a size of 1024 bytes, wereas the buffer in the
structure has a size of 140 bytes.

Since the copy is done with strncpy, with the size in the structure as a parameter,
we can choose how many bytes to copy, which means we can overwrite the return address
of the handle_msg function.

What better choice than calling the secret_backdoor function that kindly opens us
a shell?
