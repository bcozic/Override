This level is a bit more tricky.

We have a program that allows us to store numbers four bytes
at a time in the stack. We only need to give a value, and the index
of an integer array.

The only catch is that we can't store on indexes that are multiples of 3.
Those ones will be filled with zeroes.
We could store a shellcode, but it would need to be fragmented to avoid the zeroes.
We did that part.

Since we can modify the stack, we would like to modify the return address, but it is
on an index which is a multiple of 3, of course.
However, we can write at the same place with a different index thanks to overlaps...
