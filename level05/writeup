Here, we have another format string exploit.

Since there is no backdoor function, we need to insert a shellcode in the stack.
Then, we overwrite the global offset table to redirect the exit() call towards our shellcode.

The only subtlety is that our shellcode must not contain any uppercase character (they would
be lowercased).
